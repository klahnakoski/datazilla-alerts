### Python is a Little Crufty ###

Python is awesome now, but it was originally a procedural language invented
before functional semantics, before OO, and even before the
discovery of vowels.  As a consequence there are many procedures that alter
their own parameters, or have disemvoweled names.  This library puts a facade
over these relics of the past and uses convention to name methods.
